"""
This script processes a COT (Commitment of Traders) data CSV file by performing the following operations:
1. Filters the data to only include rows from the current year.
2. Sorts the data by 'Contract Name' and 'Date' in descending order.
3. Calculates the percentage of long and short positions relative to the total contracts.
4. Calculates the net percentage change in long positions compared to the previous week's data.
5. Ensures short positions are positive values and reorders the columns.
6. Saves the cleaned data into a new CSV file.
